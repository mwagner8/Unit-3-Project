# Unit-3-Project

This is a repository containing instructional materials on creating a new data set from an existing dataset of public health data. 
The new data set consists of data from the states of California, Louisiana, North Carolina, and Virginia on Adult smoking and seeks to show the correlation between that and adult obesity and poor mental health days. 
The purpose of this dataset is to prove whether or not there is a correlation between smoking and poor mental health days and obesity and to see how much it varies by state.
The original data set of all states and other statistics is also included. 
The visualisations are included below, the links will allow you to more closely interact with the data; mostly you can isolate the statistics by state.
